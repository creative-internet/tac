      <h5 class="uppercase">What type of information do we collect</h5>
      
      <p>We may collect information from you in a variety of different ways. 
      This is information that may identify you, and anonymous information, 
      such as the number of your page views, link clicks, and login times.
      Your information may be kept in an identifiable format, or in an aggregate format 
      which means that you cannot reasonably be identified from it. We provide further
      detail on the type of info we collect, and how we collect it, below</p><br />

      <p><b>Automatically Captured Information.</b> We automatically collect information 
      from your computer and/or device when you use the Services. This allows us to
      assess how you have used the Services, the device you have used them on and helps 
      us to analyse how we can optimize the Services for you in the future.
      This information may include:  </p><br />
      <ul>
        <li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address;</li>

        <li>your browser and platform type;</li>
        <li>your browser language; and</li>
        <li>the data in any undeleted "cookies" that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below).</li>
      </ul><br />
 
      <p>Additionally, when you enter a search query using the Site or Services, 
      we will receive the query text and process it, together with the above data, 
      to return a search results page to you. If you have modified your browser settings 
      so that address-bar search queries and erroneous domain name system (DNS) 
      requests are submitted to us, we may also receive any search query or misspelled URL 
      that you enter into your browser's address bar.</p><br />

 
      <p><b>Mobile:</b> If you access the Site through a mobile device we may collect additional 
      information including: (i) the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your mobile device;

      <p>When accessing through mobile, the application may provide you such access by
      placing a search icon on your home screen. In order to remove the search icon on
      the homepage of your mobile device, click and hold the search icon, and depending
      on the make and model of your mobile device, either (i) drag it to the trash in 
      the bottom of the screen, (ii) click the red "x" bottom on the top right corner 
      of the search icon, or (iii) remove the search icon as you would remove any icon in
      the normal and customary manner effectuated through your mobile device. </p><br />


      <p><b>Other Technologies:</b> We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons, cookies
      and other similar technologies,to track your use of the Services (see our  <a href="../../cpp/en/cookies.html">cookie policy</a>).

      of an account name or email address in order to use them. However,
